Goals:
What features of a watch have a stronger association on price?
Analyze watch prices based on their features to determine which features affect prices and by how much. 
What brands tend to sell the most expensive watches? What brands tend to sell the more affordable watches? 
Do these prices seem to relate to the features of the watch, or does the brand's name seem to play a role?
